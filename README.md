<p>This is the first incarnation of Wordy-Bastards. The idea came from when I was a kid I had heard a rumor that Charles Dickens was so drawn out and wordy because he was paid by the word. After finishing A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations back to back I needed to know how to break this down without having to read another Dicken's narrative.</p>

<p>The next step for Wordy-Bastards will be an author brawl. Comparing the hashes spit-out by Wordy-Bastards to finally determine the wordiest bastard.</p>
