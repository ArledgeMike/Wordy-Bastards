<h2>A Ruby Command Line Word Counting App</h2>

<p>Version 1.0 - dickens</p>

<p>Another command line tool written in Ruby. Lots of authors have the dubious distinction of being too wordy. Follow the instructions at the prompt and see a complete word count from some of the classics we supplied you with.</p>

<ul>

<li>2.) Open yout terminal and CD to the director that holds wordy-bastards</li>

<li>3.) Type "ruby LineByLine.rb"</li>

<li>4.) Type in the director listing of the text file you want to have read. (We supplied you with a few one of them is definitely not a classic)</li>

<li>5.) A new .txt should be in your directory with a proper list of words and the number of times they have been used</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the first incarnation of Wordy-Bastards. The idea came from when I was a kid I had heard a rumor that Charles Dickens was so drawn out and wordy because he was paid by the word. After finishing A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations back to back I needed to know how to break this down without having to read another Dicken's narrative.</p>

<p>The next step for Wordy-Bastards will be an author brawl. Comparing the hashes spit-out by Wordy-Bastards to finally determine the wordiest bastard.</p>
